Select all three lines and delete them to get a blank space.

If you dont see these three lines, create a new blank indicator script. 
Towards the right you will see:

"Open", "New", "Save", "Add to Chart", "Publish SCript" and "Help"

Click "New" and at the top, select "New Blank Indicator" at the top of the list.
Then you will see the three lines mentioned above. Delete them to get a blank space to drop the Indicator text into.

Copy all the text from the indicator text file and paste it into the blank Pine Script editor window.

Then click "Save", a dialog window will pop up asking you to name it, just click "Save" if you're happy with the name it suggests, otherwise give it a name.
